This project finds the best supervised machine learning model, based on test accuracy, for two problems, one linear and one categorical.

The linear model looks to explain test scores for students in California. The chosen model is a ridge regression where alpha = 10.

The categorical model looks to separate red wines from white wines. The chosen model is a penalized logistic regression.
